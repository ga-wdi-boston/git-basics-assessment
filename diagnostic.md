# Git Basics Diagnostic

Write your answers inside this file, where it's indicated by the comments.

1.We just forked a repo on GitHub and want to start working on it locally.
What command do we use to do that? Use the **correct** URL from your fork of
this repository in your answer.

```sh
<!-- git clone git@github.com:aneela06/git-basics-diagnostic.git -->
```

2.What do you do after cloning a repository, before you start making any
changes/additions?

<!-- Before making any changes we change the branch name. -->

3.What command do we use to create a new branch? Name this branch `response`
    in your answer. Then, how do we switch to that branch?

```sh
<!-- git checkout response then git -b response or you can just do git checkout -b response. -->
```

4.We just wrote some code. What command do we use to see a summary of the
    changes in our working directory?

```sh
<!-- git status -->
```

5.We want to prepare a change for a commit by adding a file to the staging
    area. What command do we use to stage a file named `diagnostic.md`?

```sh
<!-- git status -->
```

6.Once `diagnostic.md` is staged, we have to make a commit by `git commit`.
What are the two formatting items you **need** to make up your commit message?

<!-- Two formatting items needed to commit a message are the heading of the commit message which gives you an idea of what the change was.  THen you can add in more detail in the line after of what you changed.  -->
