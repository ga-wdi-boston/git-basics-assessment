1.We just forked a repo on GitHub and want to start working on it locally.
What command do we use to do that?
https://github.com/SandyPok/git-basics-diagnostic

```sh
<!-- I would go into terminal and type "Git clone (URL)" -->
```

2.What do you do after cloning a repository, before you start making any
changes/additions?

<!-- Git commit -->

3.What command do we use to create a new branch? Name this branch `response`in your answer. Then, how do we switch to that branch?

<!-- Git branch response, git checkout response-->
```

4.We just wrote some code. What command do we use to see a summary of the changes in our working directory?

<!-- Git status-->
```

5.We want to prepare a change for a commit by adding a file to the staging area. What command do we use to stage a file named `diagnostic.md`?

<!-- I think "git add -a" not quite sure if this is the right answer-->
```

6.Once `diagnostic.md` is staged, we have to make a commit by `git commit`.
What are the two formatting items you **need** to make up your commit message?

<!-- git commit -m (Add your message here)-->
