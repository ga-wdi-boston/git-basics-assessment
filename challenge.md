## Challenge

Write your answers inside this file, where it's indicated by the comments.

1. We just forked a repo on GitHub.com and want to start working on it locally. What command do we use to do that?

After you fork a repo you copy the SSH URL and then type 'git clone [SSH URL]' in the terminal

2. OK, we just wrote some code. What command could we use to see a list of all the changes that have been made since the last commit?

git diff HEAD^x HEAD^y

3. We want to see more info about a specific commit, specifically who created the commit and when it was done. What command would one use?

git log

4. We are tasked with working on a new feature. And want to seperate our work from others in the project. What you we do? What git command would one use?

You need to create a new branch: git checkout -b branch_name


5. I want to add a file to the staging area. What git commit would I use?

git add 'directory_name'

6. I've been working on a branch, add-directories, to implement a feature. The feature is done and you need to add your changes into the master branch. What git command should I use?

First you need to stage the changes: git add add-directories. Next you commit the changes: git commit add-directories (and make a comment in the commit editor). After you commit you need to push the file back to github: git push origin master. Finally make a pull request on github.
